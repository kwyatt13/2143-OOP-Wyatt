## Definitions

#### Abstraction
> Abstraction in object oriented programming is the simplification of data by extracting what is needed from a larger set of data.

#### Attributes/Properties
> Attributes or Properties are aspects, or characteristics, of components of the program, such as member variables of a class.

#### Class
> A class is a structure in programming that is used to create an object with the class as its abstract data type. Classes can contain other classes as well.

#### Class Variable
> A class variable is any variable to hold data that is used within a class. Defines an attribute or property for a data structure.

#### Composition
> Composition is use of classes within classes and functions within functions. Essentially stacking methods to combine simpler functions into more complex ones.

#### Encapsulation
> Encapsulation is taking multiple methods that work on the same data and putting them together in a more specific scope. Essentially, encapsulation is bundling functions with data inside of a class.

#### Friends
> Friends are functions that are given the same access to private or protected data as methods.

#### Inheritance
> Inheritance is the concept of basing a class upon a preexisting class and "inheriting" member variables and methods from another class.

#### Instance Variable
> An Instance Variable is a variable for which each instance of an object has its own copy of the given variable.

#### Member Variable
>  A member variable is a variable that is a member of a class or other data type. Member varaibles are often protected within the class.

#### Method
> A method is a function that is specific to a class or object. Methods serve as functions that usually deal with initializing, editing, reading, and etc. a given objects properties.

#### Multiple Inheritance
> Multiple Inheritance is inheriting member variables and methods from multiple base classes. 

#### Object
> An object is an instance of a programmer defined data type. Objects contain methods, variables and etc. that make them the core principle of object oriented programming. A class is an example of a type of template that is used to create an instance of an object.

#### Overloading
> Overloading is creating multiple versions of the same function or method with the same name but different parameters.

#### Polymorphism
> Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms, or be viewed and used in multiple ways.

#### Public / Private / Protected
> Public, Private, and Protected are keywords used to define the protections of a member variable or function of a class. Private can only be accessed within the class or by friend functions. Protected has an additional layer that it can also be used by classes derived from the initial class. Public can be accessed anywhere throughout the program.

#### Virtual
> Virtual in Computer Science refers to a digital copy or similar conceptual version of something real. A good example would be that an array is a virtual version of a list of numbers on paper.
